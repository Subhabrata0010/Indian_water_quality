# 📊 Data Analysis Project on Indian Water Quality

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of water quality data across various states in India. The project uses **Python** libraries such as **Pandas, Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib** to explore, visualize, and model the data, providing insights into the different parameters affecting water quality. This README provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including the dataset, analysis, and findings.

## 📜 About The Project
The primary goal of this project is to analyze water quality in **India** by examining various chemical and biological parameters. The analysis explores the distribution of these parameters, identifies correlations between them, and builds predictive models to classify water quality. The key objectives of this project are:

To provide a detailed exploratory data analysis of water quality parameters such as **pH, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), and dissolved oxygen.**

To visualize the data to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in water quality across different states and water body types.

To build and evaluate machine learning models to predict water quality based on the available data.

The project is structured to be easily reproducible, with all the necessary code and data included in this repository.
